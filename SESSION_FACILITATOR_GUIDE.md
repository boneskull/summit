# 💁🏽 Session Facilitator Guide

This document is intended to provide a helpful starting point or reference for running sessions during summits.
The new learnings and tools from a summit will ideally be PR'd in when each is concluded.

🎉 Lists are included 🎉

## 📅 in the days leading up to the session
- [ ] If applicable, port the agenda into [tcq](https://tcq.app/)
- [ ] Set a chair/facilitator for the session

## 🛫 pre-flight checklist (when about to begin the session)
- [ ]  If not pre-arranged, find consensus on a chair for the session. Scheduled sessions are likely to already have a facilitator/chair. Ad-hoc sessions will need someone to make sure everyone walks out of the room with actionable items.
- [ ] If not pre-arranged, ask the table for volunteer note taker.
- [ ] Have a person be take charge of each tool being used for the session. For a full list of tools see below.
- [ ] Go to Zoom, start the call.
- [ ] In Zoom, make sure the link to the zoom session is posted on the relevant thread in [nodejs/summit](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues/).
- [ ] In Zoom, start recording the session.
- [ ] Go to Otter, start recording the audio.

## 🛠 tools for effective sessions

1. [tcq](https://tcq.app/): for facilitating onsite and remote discussion during the sessions
2. [zoom](https://zoom.us/signin): for video conferencing in remote participants and recording the sessions. Here are [links](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200208179-Recording) to docs for recording the zoom sessions.
3. [google hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com): an alternative to zoom, without recording functionality
4. [otter](https://otter.ai): is for recording meeting audio and complementing the note-taker's efforts

## 🛬 Post-session checklist

- [ ] Chair/facilitator syncs up with participants and note-takers.
